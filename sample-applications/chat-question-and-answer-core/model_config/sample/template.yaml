# Configuration Template for  ChatQnA Core Application
# This template provides a standard structure for defining model settings.
# Users should customize the values according to their specific requirements.

model_settings:
  # ID of the embedding model to be used.
  # Example: "BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5"
  EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID: "<your_embedding_model_id_here>"

  # ID of the reranker model to be used.
  # Example: "BAAI/bge-reranker-base"
  RERANKER_MODEL_ID: "<your_reranker_model_id_here>"

  # ID of the large language model (LLM) to be used.
  # Example: "Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3"
  LLM_MODEL_ID: "<your_llm_model_id_here>"

  # Template for the prompt used by the assistant.
  # Customize the prompt to fit the context and requirements of your application.
  # Example:
    # <|System|>
    # Use the following pieces of context from retrieved
    # dataset to answer the question. Do not make up an answer if there is no
    # context provided to help answer it.

    # <|Context|>
    # {context}

    # <|User|>
    # {question}

    # <|Assistant|>
  PROMPT_TEMPLATE: "<your_prompt_template_here>"

  # Note: Ensure the prompt template is formatted correctly and includes necessary placeholders.

  # Additional model settings can be added under `model_settings` as needed.
  # For example, you might include MAX_TOKENS, ENABLE_RERANK or DEVICE settings.

  # Maximum number of tokens for the model's response.
  # Example: 1024 <Rely on LLM model's total context length>
  # MAX_TOKENS: <your_max_tokens_value_here>

  # Enable or disable reranking of results.
  # Example: true or false
  # ENABLE_RERANK: <true_or_false>

# [OPTIONAL] Device settings for model execution.
# Specify the device on which each model will run.
# Depends on user system configuration. Default will set to use "CPU".

device_settings:
  # EMBEDDING_DEVICE: "<your_embedding_device_here>"  # e.g: "CPU", "GPU"
  # RERANKER_DEVICE: "<your_reranker_device_here>"    # e.g: "CPU", "GPU"
  # LLM_DEVICE: "<your_llm_device_here>"              # e.g: "CPU", "GPU"

# Ensure to validate the YAML syntax and structure when customizing this template.
